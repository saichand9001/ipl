  The Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) are a franchise cricket team representing the city of Kolkata in the Indian Premier
  League. The franchise is owned by Bollywood actor Shah Rukh Khan, actress Juhi Chawla and her spouse Jay Mehta. The home
  of the Knight Riders is the iconic Eden Gardens stadium.
  
  The franchise, which has gained immense popularity due to its association with celebrity owners, qualified for the IPL
  playoffs for the first time in 2011. They became the IPL champions in 2012, by defeating Chennai Super Kings in the
  final. They repeated the feat in 2014, defeating Kings XI Punjab. The Knight Riders hold the record for the longest
  winning streak by any Indian team in T20s (14).
  
  The leading run-scorer of the side is Gautam Gambhir, while the leading wicket-taker is Sunil Narine. The official
  theme of the team is Korbo, Lorbo, Jeetbo Re (we will perform, fight and win!) and the official colours are purple and
  gold. The brand value of the Knight Riders was estimated at $104 million in 2018, second highest among IPL
  franchises. In 2019, their value was estimated at â‚¹629 crore (US$88 million).
