      The Royal Challengers Bangalore (often abbreviated as RCB) are a franchise
      cricket team based in Bangalore, Karnataka, that plays in the Indian
      Premier League (IPL). It was founded in 2008 by United Spirits and named
      after the company's liquor brand Royal Challenge. Since its inception, the
      team has played its home matches at the M. Chinnaswamy Stadium. The Royal
      Challengers have never won the IPL but finished runners-up on three
      occasions between 2009 and 2016. Their lack of success over the years
      despite the presence of various notable players has earned them the tag of
      "underachievers."[2][3] The team holds the records of both the highest and
      the lowest totals in the IPL â€“ 263/5 and 49 respectively.
