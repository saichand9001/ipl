      The Rajasthan Royals (often abbreviated as RR) are a franchise cricket
      team based in Jaipur, Rajasthan, that plays in the Indian Premier League
      (IPL). Founded in 2008 as one of the initial eight IPL franchises, the
      team is based at the Sawai Mansingh Stadium in Jaipur. The Rajasthan
      Royals are sometimes considered as the "moneyball" team of the IPL. The
      Royals are known to unearth obscure, high potential talent, as well as
      their involvement in a number of controversies and scandals. The team won
      the inaugural edition of the IPL under the captaincy of Shane Warne,
      despite being written off as a title contender by the media and fans. The
      Royals were also the runners-up of the 2013 Champions League Twenty20
      under Rahul Dravid's captaincy. On 14 July 2015, the verdict reached by a
      panel appointed by the Supreme Court of India suspended Rajasthan Royals
      and Chennai Super Kings for two years over a 2013 betting scandal, meaning
      they could not participate in both the 2016 and 2017 IPL tournaments. They
      returned to the competition for the 2018 season. The team's record
      run-scorer is Ajinkya Rahane with 2705 runs, while the leading
      wicket-taker is Shane Watson, with 67
