      The Sunrisers Hyderabad (often abbreviated as SRH) are a franchise cricket
      team based in Hyderabad, Telangana, India, that plays in the Indian
      Premier League (IPL). The franchise is owned by Kalanithi Maran of the Sun
      TV Network and was founded in 2012 after the Hyderabad-based Deccan
      Chargers were terminated by the IPL. The team is currently captained by
      David Warner and coached by Trevor Bayliss. The primary homeground of the
      team is the Rajiv Gandhi International Cricket Stadium, Hyderabad with a
      capacity of 55,000. The brand value of the Sunrisers Hyderabad was
      estimated to be ₹483 crore (US$68 million) in 2019 as the overall brand of
      IPL was increased to ₹47,000 crore (US$6.6 billion), according to Duff &
      Phelps. The team made their first IPL appearance in 2013, where they
      reached the playoffs, eventually finishing in fourth place. The Sunrisers
      won their maiden IPL title in the 2016 season, defeating Royal Challengers
      Bangalore by 8 runs in the final. The team has qualified for the play-off
      stage of the tournament in every season since 2016. In 2018, the team
      reached the finals of the Indian Premier League, but lost to Chennai Super
      Kings by 8 Wickets, following a century by Shane Watson. The team is
      considered one of the best bowling sides, often admired for its ability to
      defend low totals. David Warner is the leading run scorer for the side,
      having won the Orange Cap 3 times, in 2015, 2017, and 2019. Bhuvneshwar
      Kumar is the leading wicket-taker.
