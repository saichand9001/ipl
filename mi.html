      The Mumbai Indians is a franchise cricket team based in Mumbai,
      Maharashtra, that competes in the Indian Premier League. Founded in 2008,
      the team is owned by India's biggest conglomerate, Reliance Industries,
      through its 100% subsidiary IndiaWin Sports. Since its establishment, the
      team has played its home matches in the 33,108-capacity Wankhede Stadium
      in Mumbai. In 2017, the Mumbai Indians became the first franchise to cross
      the $100 million mark in brand value among the IPL franchises. The brand
      value of Mumbai Indians, in 2019, is estimated to be around â‚¹809 crore
      (roughly $115 million), the highest among all the IPL franchises for the
      fourth consecutive year. Mumbai Indians is the most successful team in the
      IPL. They won the 2011 Champions League Twenty20 after beating Royal
      Challengers Bangalore by 31 runs in the final. The team won the double by
      winning its first IPL title, in 2013, by defeating Chennai Super Kings by
      23 runs in the final, and then defeated the Rajasthan Royals by 33 runs to
      win its second Champions League Twenty20 title later that year. They won
      their second IPL title on 24 May 2015 by defeating the Chennai Super Kings
      by 41 runs in the final and became the third team to win more than one IPL
      title. On 21 May 2017, they won their third IPL title by defeating the
      Rising Pune Supergiant by 1 run in a thrilling final, thus becoming the
      first team to win three IPL titles.[7] While playing the tournament, they
      won their 100th T20, becoming the first team to do so. In 2019, they
      repeated the same feat as they won a record breaking fourth IPL title, by
      beating CSK by just 1 run on 12 May 2019 in IPL Final
